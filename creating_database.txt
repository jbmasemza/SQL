Creating a database

1.Create a database called “Umuzi”.

2.Create the following tables in the Umuzi database:
        Customers
        Employees
        Orders
        Payments
        Products

3.Create a primary key for each table with auto-increment (make sure you correctly specify the data types, e.g. the ID field should be int).

4.Create foreign keys so that every ID in the order table references an existing ID in the tables referenced (e.g., ProductID, EmployeeID, etc).

5.INSERT the records in the tables below into the table you created in step 2.

6.Document what information is stored in your database. Be sure to say what information is kept in what table, and which keys link the records between tables.
